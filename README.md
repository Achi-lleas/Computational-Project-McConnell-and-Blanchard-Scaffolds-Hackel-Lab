This is a protein engineering project by undergraduate students in the Hackel Lab of the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.

We aim to model the interactions between the protein binding scaffolds identified by McConnell _et al._ (2023) and Blanchard _et al._ (2023) and their targets using AlphaFold3 and ChimeraX.

Then we will use algorithms to identify the amino acid enrichment and common amino acid motifs that are found in the paratope of these binding scaffolds.
