# Achilleas Thomas 01/28/2025:
# This is a protein engineering project by undergraduate students in the Hackel Lab of the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.
# We aim to model the interactions between the protein binding scaffolds identified by McConnell _et al._ (2023) and Blanchard _et al._ (2023) and their targets using AlphaFold3.
# Then we will use algorithms to identify common amino acid motifs that are found in the paratope of these binding scaffolds.
